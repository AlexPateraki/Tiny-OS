# Tiny-OS
In this work, some extensions to the kernel of a simple operating system are implemented, which we will call TINYOS-3. Unlike the operating systems we use, our system will not run directly on the hardware of the system. Instead, it will run as a process of another operating system, Linux, using simulated resources, meaning it will run in a (basic) virtual machine. So, instead of TINYOS-3 managing the hardware resources of a computer, it will manage the resources (CPU time, memory, peripherals, etc.) provided to it by the host operating system (Linux). Apart from this difference, TINYOS-3 will perform the basic functions of a real operating system.
